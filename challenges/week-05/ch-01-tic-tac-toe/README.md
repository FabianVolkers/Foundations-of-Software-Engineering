In this assignment, you are going to learn a whole lot more about JavaScript by coding a video game that will run the browser: Tic-Tac-Toe

Your Instructions
Create a website which allows you to play Tic-Tac-Toe (naughts and crosses). There should be two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. If the board is full and no player has placed a row of 3 marks, the game ends in a draw. There is a screenshot of what this could look like, but the design is up to you.

Details and FAQ:
- It does not matter which player starts; it does matter that each turn is taken by a different person (so, if X has the first move, O has the second, then X again, and so on…).
- When the game ends, it should notify the player of the result of the game, such that “Player X wins”, “Player O wins”, or “The game ends in a draw”.
- A player is not allowed to play on a space which has already been taken.

Umm, where do I start?
- The first thing to do is setup your code for a basic website. These are steps that you should start to get comfortable with. Start a new repository (tic-tac-toe), and create three files for yourself: an index.html with some a basic header, a css style sheet which contains some basic style and is included in your HTML, and a javascript file (called whatever you would like). Make suer that the JS and CSS are included in your HTML. This is the starting point of many websites. If you are unsure about how to do this, have a look at the files in Foundations/javascript/example4. Once you have a basic setup running, to do you first git commit, and make sure it all runs in the browser as you would expect.
- Ok, now you have the setup to run a basic website frontend! congratulations :). Time to start the hard work. First, try to decide what will be done in HTML, what will be in CSS, and what will be in JS. I suggest setting up as much as possible in HTML and CSS to get the basic structure and the design of the page, and then add the functionality in JavaScript on top.

Learning Resources (linked)
There are a lot of learning resources attached below. If you would like to follow a full tutorial, choose one of the linked courses from the FreeCodeCamp, Codecademy, and Udacity. The MDN pages could be used as a tutorial, but are probably more useful for reference. The W3Schools tutorial is a quicker way to jump in, though many students seem to find the FreeCodeCamp to be similar but better.

There are many ways to solve this problem. One of them is explained in detail on Medium and linked below, together with a solution's code on GitHub. There are also many youtube tutorials which solve a version of tic-tac-toe which walk you through writing the code step-by-step.
