# Week 01 - Challenge 01 - First Webpage Ever

## Instructions

By 1990, the first website was running on a server set up by Tim Brenners-Lee at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. For a recent project at CERN on the history of the web, a copy of that site was brought back on line, visible here: http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html

Your task is to re-create the start page of that website, which you can do with only HTML. There are many pages linked from that starting page - please create the first additional page, linked from the word "hypermedia". Other pages need not be linked anywhere. So, you should have 2 pages in the end: one which looks like TheProject.html, and one which is linked from it, and looks like WhatIs.html.
