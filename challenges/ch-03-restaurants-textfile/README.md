The Restaurants Assignment is in Google Classrooms. The explanation can be found in the [wiki](/wiki/Challenges/Restaurants-txt).

Create a website which lists restaurants in Berlin together with the neighborhood they are in, taking that information from a text file. There should be at least 3 restaurants listed.

This exercise practices:
- setting up a repository for software development using git
- separating data (the restaurant list) from logic (the code which generates the website)
- dynamic webpage generation
- the principle of a single source of truth
- Python, HTML, CSS, and Networking
- Use of classes and designing a simple data model

We will launch these websites live on the real internet in class on Thursday, and we will continue building on this project in future weeks.
